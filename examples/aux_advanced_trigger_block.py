"""
Auxiliary trigger example for a PicoScope 6000E device

Description:
  This example script captures a single acquisition with minimal abstraction
  It is intended to demonstrate how to use the pyPicoSDK library to automate
  your PicoScope device

Requirements:
- PicoScope 6000E
- Python packages:
  (pip install) matplotlib numpy pypicosdk

Setup:
  - Connect 6000E AWG output to AUX trig input and Channel A
    of the oscilloscope using a tee BNC connector, cable, or probe
