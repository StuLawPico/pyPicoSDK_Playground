# Welcome to pyPicoSDK Documentation
## Installation
### Prerequisites 
1. Go to PicoTech downloads [picotech.com/downloads](https://www.picotech.com/downloads)
2. Find your PicoScope in the list and click through
3. Download and install PicoSDK for your operating system
### Via Pip
1. Install the package via pip `pip install pypicosdk`
2. In your `main.py` add `import pypicosdk` or `import pypicosdk as psdk`

### Via GitHub (Inc examples)
1. Install github repository to folder `git clone https://github.com/StuLawPico/pyPicoSDK_Playground.git`
2. In the root directory (where setup.py is) run `pip install .`
3. In your `main.py` add `import pypicosdk` or `import pypicosdk as psdk`

## Quickstart
To test functionality of this library, copy and run the following python script:
```
import pypicosdk as psdk

scope = psdk.ps6000a()

scope.open_unit()
print(scope.get_unit_serial())
scope.close_unit()
```
The output should be similar to:
`JR001/001`

Once tested, try an [example script from github](https://github.com/StuLawPico/pyPicoSDK_Playground) to get started.

## Example style
All examples pass arguments inline when calling API functions. This keeps each
call self-contained and helps highlight the values in use:

```python
scope.set_channel(channel=psdk.CHANNEL.A, range=psdk.RANGE.V1)
```

If you prefer, you can assign your own variables before calling the API:

```python
RANGE = psdk.RANGE.V1
scope.set_channel(channel=psdk.CHANNEL.A, range=RANGE)
```

Timebase values are typically chosen using ``sample_rate_to_timebase``:

```python
TIMEBASE = scope.sample_rate_to_timebase(50, psdk.SAMPLE_RATE.MSPS)
# TIMEBASE = 2  # direct driver timebase
# TIMEBASE = scope.interval_to_timebase(20E-9)
```

### Streaming Quickstart
The following snippet performs a basic streaming capture using `run_simple_streaming_capture`:
```python
import pypicosdk as psdk

scope = psdk.ps6000a()
scope.open_unit()
scope.set_channel(psdk.CHANNEL.A, psdk.RANGE.V1)
scope.set_simple_trigger(psdk.CHANNEL.A, threshold_mv=0)
data, times = scope.run_simple_streaming_capture(
    sample_interval=1,
    sample_interval_time_units=psdk.PICO_TIME_UNIT.US,
    samples=1000,
    auto_stop=True,
    datatype=psdk.DATA_TYPE.INT16_T,
    ratio_mode=psdk.RATIO_MODE.RAW,
)
scope.close_unit()
```
