## Rapid Block Example
```python
import pypicosdk as psdk

scope = psdk.ps6000a()
scope.open_unit()
scope.set_channel(psdk.CHANNEL.A, psdk.RANGE.V1)
scope.set_simple_trigger(psdk.CHANNEL.A, threshold_mv=0)
captures, time_axis = scope.run_simple_rapid_block_capture(
    timebase=2,
    samples=1000,
    n_captures=10,
)
scope.close_unit()
```
This helper configures memory segments, sets the capture count and retrieves
all captures using ``GetValuesBulk``. See the API reference for details on
``set_no_of_captures`` and ``get_values_bulk``.

## Trigger Time Offset Bulk Example
Retrieve trigger offsets for multiple captures obtained in rapid block mode.

```python
import pypicosdk as psdk

scope = psdk.ps6000a()
scope.open_unit()
scope.set_channel(psdk.CHANNEL.A, psdk.RANGE.V1)
scope.set_simple_trigger(psdk.CHANNEL.A, threshold_mv=0)
buffers, time_axis = scope.run_simple_rapid_block_capture(
    timebase=2,
    samples=1000,
    n_captures=4,
    ratio=1,
    ratio_mode=psdk.RATIO_MODE.TRIGGER,
)
offsets = scope.get_values_trigger_time_offset_bulk(0, 3)
scope.close_unit()
```
``offsets`` contains a list of ``(offset, PICO_TIME_UNIT)`` tuples for each
segment.

Although the driver reports very fine time offsets by interpolating between
samples, the actual usable resolution is typically no better than about one
tenth of the sampling interval.  See the
``get_trigger_time_offset`` docstring for further discussion of this
limitation.

## Dead Time Example
The `timeStampCounter` field of :class:`PICO_TRIGGER_INFO` lets you measure the delay between consecutive captures.
See `examples/example_6000a_dead_time.py` for a script that performs a rapid block run,
retrieves trigger information for each segment and plots the dead time between triggers.
Use the :data:`pypicosdk.TIMESTAMP_COUNTER_MASK` constant to handle wrap around of the
56-bit ``timeStampCounter`` field when calculating differences.
